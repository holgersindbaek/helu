# helu

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'helu'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install helu

## USAGE

#### Initialize.

Start a helu with the In App Purchase ID. Helu will check if the product exists and return the success:

    @loose_weight = Helu.new("loosing_weight_10") { |result| puts result[:success] }

You can also get more info on the product:

	@loose_weight = Helu.new("loosing_weight_10") do |result| 
		if result[:success]
			puts result[:response]
		else
			puts result[:error]
		end
	end

#### Get products (localized) price, title and description.

After you've made sure your product exists, you can now get it's price, title and description:

	@loose_weight.price
	@loose_weight.title
	@loose_weight.description

#### Purchase product.

To purchase a product do:

	@loose_weight.purchase { |result| puts result[:success] }

And if you want some more info

	@loose_weight.purchase do |result|
		if result[:success]
			puts result[:transaction]
		else
			puts result[:transaction]
		end
	end

## Example App:
